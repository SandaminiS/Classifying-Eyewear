# Classifying Eyewear on GAN-Generated Faces Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview
This project aims to classify whether individuals are wearing glasses using a dataset of synthetic human faces generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and latent vector information, the model will distinguish between 'glasses' and 'no glasses' categories. This project was conducted as part of the STA6367: Statistical Methodology in Data Science II course.

## Methodology
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: The backbone of the classification model, employing convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers to identify and classify images based on visual features.
- **Latent Vector Integration**: Incorporating latent vectors to enhance model performance through additional input layers or feature fusion techniques.

## Conclusion
This project explores the intersection of GAN-generated synthetic data and CNNs, aiming to improve image classification accuracy in real-world applications.
